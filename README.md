# Inventory-Management-Analysis
This project is a detailed SQL analysis of a sample Inventory and Order Management database using MySQL Workbench. The analysis focuses on generating business insights related to product performance, customer behavior, order trends, and category-level inventory dynamics. Key findings from the project include:
Top and Bottom Performing Products
Identified the highest and lowest selling products based on total quantity ordered.

Order Trends by Weekday
Analyzed average order item quantity by weekday to understand peak sales periods.

Profit Margin Analysis
Calculated product-wise profit margins and identified top-margin products within each category.

Cancellation Rate by Category
Determined the total items and canceled items per category, and computed the cancellation rate as a percentage.

Category-wise Sales Analysis
Explored which product categories contribute most to total sales volume.

Customer Credit Analysis
Found customers with the highest credit limits and sales contribution.

Order Status Breakdown
Analyzed total items ordered by order status (e.g., completed, canceled) across categories.

Track High Cancellation Products or Categories
Highlighted categories with high cancellation rates to support process improvement and stock planning.

The project demonstrates the use of advanced SQL techniques such as various types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN), aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MAX), conditional expressions (CASE WHEN), subqueries, and grouping with GROUP BY and ORDER BY for detailed business reporting and inventory optimization.
